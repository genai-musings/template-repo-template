## To run program

```shell
python main.py
```

## To run unit tests

```shell
pytest
```

## To build and run an instance of a Docker image locally.

### Build

Build the Docker image.

```shell
docker build -t template-repo-template .
```

### Run

Run the Docker image as a container.

```shell
docker run -it template-repo-template
```

## To pull and run an instance of the Docker image from Docker Hub

### Pull

```shell
docker pull <dockerhub-username>/template-repo-template:<tag>
```

Replace <dockerhub-username> with your Docker Hub username and <tag> with the specific tag of the Docker image you want to pull.

### Run

docker run -it <dockerhub-username>/template-repo-template:<tag>
```

Replace <dockerhub-username> with your Docker Hub username and <tag> with the specific tag of the Docker image you want to pull.

## TODO

Please review the contents of this repository and customize them to fit your project's specific requirements.

The following changes need to be made:

- Update [GitHub issue](https://github.com/orgname/reponame/issues/new) URL in ```CONTRIBUTING.md```.

- Replace ```genai-musings``` GitHub organization name in ```md-link-check.json``` with your GitHub organization name.

- Add any keys / secret files to ```.gitignore```.

- Review and update ```CHANGELOG.md```.

- Review and update ```CODEOWNERS```.

- Enable [CodeQL analysis](https://github.com/genai-musings/template-repo-template/settings/security_analysis) to identify vulnerabilities and errors with [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql), when enabling select the option to generate - ```.github/codeql.yml```: the GitHub Actions workflow for CodeQL analysis.

- Enable [Dependabot](https://github.com/genai-musings/template-repo-template/settings/security_analysis) alerts, security updates and version updates when enabling it select the option to generate - ```.github/dependabot.yml```: the configuration file controlling how Dependabot maintains the repository. **Note:** Remember to set the ```package-ecosystem`` to pip.

- Enable [Bandit](https://github.com/genai-musings/chatting-with-ChatGPT/actions/new?category=security) when enabling it select the option to generate - ```.github/bandit.yml```: the GitHub Actions workflow designed to find common security issues in Python code.

- Enable [Secret Scanning with Push Protection](https://github.com/genai-musings/template-repo-template/settings/security_analysis) to receive alerts on GitHub for detected secrets, keys, or other tokens, and to block commits which contain supported secrets.

- Add [Branch Protection](https://github.com/genai-musings/template-repo-template/settings/branches) for the main branch.

- Review and if necessary update ```dependabot.yml``` to customize Dependabot alerts.

- Replace code in ```main.py``` with your code, update tests and associated GitHub action workflows accordingly.

- Review and update ```README.md```. Remove redundant instructions such as this and update the Badges displayed including their URLs depending on which of the associated workflows you have enabled.

- Review and enable required linters in the ```.github/workflows/linter.yml``` GitHub action.

- Review and update the project dependencies in ```requirements.txt```.

- Review and update the Docker Hub details in ```.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml```. You need to replace <dockerhub-username>, <image-name>, and <tag> with your own values.

- Review and update the maintainer and description entries in the ```Dockerfile```.

- Review and update the Docker Hub details in ```.github/workflows/docker-push-readme.yml```. You need to replace <dockerhub-username> and <image-name>. You also need to update the ```short_description``` for the image.

**Note:** The username and password for Docker Hub should be stored as secrets in your GitHub repository. To set up the secrets in your GitHub repository, go to your repository page, navigate to the "Settings" tab, and then select "Secrets" from the left menu. Add a secret named DOCKERHUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username, and another secret named DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD with your Docker Hub password.
